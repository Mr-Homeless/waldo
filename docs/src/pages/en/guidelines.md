## Reviewing Guidelines

1. Submission must clearly be gameplay matching the labelled game.
2. Only one game in the submission. (Not montages of multiple games)
3. Gameplay should not be heavily edited with effects that are not present in the game itself. Small overlays are fine.
4. Gameplay can be either cheating or no cheating, doesn't matter.

## Upload Guidelines

1. The video that you are submitting must only contain content of the type of game you are submiting it as.
2. The video must not be heavily edited and only contains content of that one game.
3. If you are TRUSTED, the cheat type that you select along with the video you are uploading must match the video's cheats.
4. The video must be your own content that you have uploaded and you cannot upload someone elses videos without their permission.
