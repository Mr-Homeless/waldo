## Prerequisites

Before you can start hacking away on waldo, you need to have the tools below to ensure everything works.

- Node.js - The current `LTS` version
- Rust - So our desktop app can build
- Yarn - Our package manager of choice

## Deploying Services

Waldo Vision is dependent on a number of services, and depending on your needs, you can either self host, or use a cloud option for all of them. We recommend you self host for ease of development, but the cloud options do exist if you wish to use them.

## Setting Up A Local Deployment

First, clone the git repo `https://github.com/waldo-vision/waldo` to your machine then navigate to it using the 'cd' console command.

### Install Dependencies

You'll need to install a few dependencies in order to run the dev server:

- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) - our JavaScript package manager.
- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) - used for building and running containers.

With those installed, you can download additional packages with yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

### Configuration

The app is configured via environment variables stored within a `.env` file in this directory.

Start by copying the example env file.

```bash
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env

# Open the file
vim apps/web/.env
```

#### Discord

If you plan on authenticating to Discord, make sure these credentials are set.

- `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`
- `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET`

Follow [this guide](https://discordjs.guide/oauth2/#getting-an-oauth2-url) until you have added the `Redirect URL`. Be sure to set this to `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/discord`.

Update your .env file like so:

```.env
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID="57324592435671234019234"
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET="342759ASDa82dsaf345-ADHFUFA"
```

#### GitHub

If you plan on authenticating to GitHub, make sure these credentials are set.

- `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`
- `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`

Follow [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app). Be sure to set the `Callback URL` to `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github`.

Update your .env file like so:

```.env
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID="7482521243341245243"
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET="FDGNJO3490TNGFMGDSK"
```

#### Next Auth

Be sure to also set the `NEXTAUTH_URL` variable.

- `NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000`.

#### CloudFlare Turnstile

_TODO: add CloudFlare configuration docs_

You may also want to set the `Cloudflare Turnstile` keys so that submissions work.

#### Youtube

_TODO: add Youtube configuration docs_

You may also want to set the `Youtube API Key` so that the review site works properly.

_Note: YT API Key needs to be `version 3` of the api._

### CockroachDB

The primary database used by the app is CockroachDB. You will need a working server to run this app locally.

#### Hosting

You can easily spin up a new CockroachDB container with the `docker compose` file at the root of this repo.

```bash
# start the container
docker compose up -d

# Check that the container is running
docker ps

# If at any point you wish to shut down the container:
docker compose down
```

Alternatively, you can use CockroachDB's free [serverless tier](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/get-started-cockroachdb/) if you don't wish to self-host.

Option for Windows Users:

- <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold">WARNING: Not recommended for development, use at your own risk, no support provided</span>.
- For Windows you can download the Beta Archive from [Cockroachlabs](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/install-cockroachdb-windows.html)
  and run the exe with `./cockroach.exe start-single-node --insecure`
- Then set the `DATABASE_URL` variable in `/packages/database/.env` and `/packages/web/.env` to the url displayed on start for postgresql
- You even have a Web interface for management and debugging
- WARNING BETA: (From their site: The CockroachDB executable for Windows is experimental and not suitable for production deployments. Windows 8 or higher is required.)

#### Configuration

You will now need to set the `DATABASE_URL` variable in two configuration files:

- `apps/web/.env`
- `packages/database/.env`. If you haven't already, create this file with `cp packages/database/.env.example packages/database/.env`.

If self-hosting using the `docker compose` method, then you can set your variable like so:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://root@localhost:26257?sslmode=disable"
```

#### Migration

With your configuration set, you should be ready to run the migrations needed for our ORM to work.

```bash
yarn turbo db:generate
yarn turbo run db:push
```

### Starting the server

With your environment configured, you should be ready to start the dev server.

```bash
yarn workspace web dev
```

Alternatively, you can build an optimized deployment of the app and deploy that instead.

```bash
# Build the app
yarn workspace web build

# Serve the app
yarn workspace web start
```

You should now be able to visit the website at http://localhost:3000.

## Additional notes

### Workspaces

The Project uses [yarn workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/cli/workspace), which are defined in `/package.json`.

Each submodule (database/webfrontend/webbackend/desktop app) defines its own `package.json` which is then used by yarn to run commands on it.

For example, running the webfrontend can be done with: `yarn workspace web start`.

## Picking work

> Please follow the GitHub Projects, Milestones, and Issues:

- [Projects](https://github.com/orgs/waldo-vision/projects/6) detail current side projects or larger systems.
- [Milestones](https://github.com/waldo-vision/waldo/milestones) detail current priority goals.
- [Issues](https://github.com/waldo-vision/waldo/issues) detail individual features, bugs and tweaks to work on.

When picking work, please take note of an issue's labels. For example, we ask that you consider issues marked as `critical` or `bug` to be of the highest priority. Issues marked as `good first issue` are a good place to start, and anything tagged with `help wanted` is something we are actively looking for help with. Once you have chosen an issue, please assign yourself to it, and/or leave a comment on the issue to let us know you are working on it.

_Please keep in touch with our team via Discord, so we know whoâ€™s working on what._
